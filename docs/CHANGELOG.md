# CHANGELOG

**NOTE: The `CHANGELOG.md` file in this documentation is maintained independently of the package's `CHANGELOG.md` file. Please take note of this distinction.**

The `CHANGELOG.md` file in this documentation provides a high-level overview of the changes, bug fixes, and new features introduced in each version of `Jhakaas UI`. It helps you understand the evolution of the project and decide which version suits your requirements.

**Important: Do not move or remove this line. Always keep it as the first thing in this file.**
